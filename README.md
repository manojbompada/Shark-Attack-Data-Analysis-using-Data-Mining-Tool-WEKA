# Shark-Attack-Data-Analysis-using-Data-Mining-Tool-WEKA
A good analysis is carried out on various reasons behind shark attacks in North Carolina using Data Mining tool WEKA

Project Objective

The project is aimed at applying data mining techniques and tools to solve a real-world problem performing a real-world  KDD (knowledge discovery from data) task from the beginning (domain knowledge, data collection, denormalization, pre-processing, cleaning, etc), to model building and the final stage (evaluation and presentation, future work).

Statement of the Problem

If you live in North Carolina you know there has been a “shark problem” this summer at the shore.  What is causing the problem?  Is it really a problem?  Is there a way to predict when/where shark attacks are more likely to occur?  Is North Carolina really that unusual?  What other questions are useful to explore?

Tool used: Weka
